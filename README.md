# Hello World!
### My name is Jan-Hendrik Koloska
I'm a passionate software developer from Germany. I started programming in C# when I was 13 years old. Over the time I had several breaks where I tried out different other programming languages like Java, C++, Python but my great love is still C#.

After I finished school I started studying mathematics and later computer science at the university of Paderborn. However, I faced challenges in both fields of study that I could not solve. I struggled with mathematical intuition. Finally I ended studying without a degree.

During the study I started working part time as an order picker in a warehouse. I also had different other tasks there. After I ended studying I turned in as a full time order picker in the same company.

One day I found a vacancy offer as a Junior Software Developer C# in the headquarters of my company on the company's website. Immediately I started writing an application. My boss submitted my application there with a personal recommendation. They invited me to a job interview but finally they employed another applicant. But my application attracted attention in another department where they also needed a software developer. Although they needed a fully experienced software developer they employed me for an internship for two months. After this time they decided to employ me for the next two years.
Now after one year I learned a lot about
-	The projects in our department
-	C# programming in our projects
-	Database programming with T-SQL
-	Designing reports with the SQL Server Reporting Services
-	Creating SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services) packages for our projects

at work. But thatâ€™s not all even at home I continued learning about
-	PowerShell
-	Git & GitHub
-	Entity Framework Core
-	ASP.NET Core especially Web API development
-	Clean Code

Of course there is still so much to learn but my ambitions are very high and I have a lot of goals I want to achieve. For example I want to become an expert in
-	Software architecture
-	Software quality
-	.NET Development with C#
-	ASP.NET Core 
-	Entity Framework Core

And here I am still on my journey to become a full software developer. And even with this goal achieved the learning never ends ...
